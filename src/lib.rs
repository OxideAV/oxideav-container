//! Container traits (demuxer + muxer) and a registry.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately dependency-light: it defines the abstract
//! [`Demuxer`] / [`Muxer`] traits that every container implementation
//! (oxideav-mp4, oxideav-mkv, oxideav-flac, oxideav-ogg, …) fulfils,
//! plus a [`registry::ContainerRegistry`] that the consumers of the
//! framework use to pick a demuxer by probe bytes or filename hint.
